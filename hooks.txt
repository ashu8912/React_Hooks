React Hooks 

1.class Fields solved problem of writing a constructor always to initialize class fields

useState is the tool to preserve values between functional calls/renders and to trigger a rerender of the component

useState vs setState
in setState each state field is present on the state object whereas in useState each state field is defined by each unique useState
call where the initial value to that field and the updater function is specified

in setState if one field is updated the other state fields are not updated whereas in case of useState each time we pass a new value
the old ones are completely changed from that state field this can happen in case of object as state field and you want to update a 
specific part of that object in such cases we use another hook useReducer

in setState we can pass a callback function where we specify the current value and change state based on that
in useState we do the same

in useState we have something called lazy state initialization suppose your initial values to state are calculated after a function invocation
and now that function has a heavy calculation inside it than at each render we would be doing that unnecessary invocation rather we can 
pass a callback to useState and let it return the heavy calcuation function that way react knows that this is to be invoked only once



syntax
function Theme(){
  const [theme,setTheme]=React.useState('dark')

  return <button onClick={()=>setTheme('light')}>light</button>
}


The useEffect hook so whenever we want to make side effects(interacting with outside world) in our app we use the useEffect hook
The useEffect function invokes its callback whenever react renders everything and browser has also painted that.
now React.useEffect(()=>getProfile('ashu').then(setUser))
the above effect leads to an infinite loop situtation coz once the render and painting is being done the effect runs and it triggers
a rerender which than invokes the effect again.
to prevent this we pass a second argument to useEffect to tell the hook on what value changes should the hook be invoked

based on this there are 3 situations
1.React.useEffect(()=>{
  //will be invoked on initial render and all subsequent rerenders
})
2.React.useEffect(()=>{
  //will be invoked on the initial render and when "id" or "auth" change
},[id,auth])
3.React.useEffect(()=>{
  //will be invoked only on initial render
},[])


we can do clean up of effect by writing the clean up code in the returned function of useEffect 
React.useEffect(()=>{
  subscribe(username)
  return ()=>{
    unsubscribe(username)
    setProfile(null)
  }
},[username])


after the render the cleanup code runs and than new effect is invoked



Custom Hooks helps in seperating non visual logic from UI

Problem-the easiest way to reuse stateful logic in react is by copying/pasting

Solution before hooks was higher order components and render props

Render Prop:They are created by enabling a component to accepts a 
function prop that it will use to render its children

//example of render prop
<DataProvider render={data => (
  <h1>Hello {data.target}</h1>
)}/>


const [state,dispatch]=React.useReducer((state,action)=>{

},initialValue)

useState and useReducer both allow us add state to the functional component but the difference
is useReducer allows us to do declarative state updates whereas in useState we do imperative state updates 
which is cool if there isn't a lot of state living inside my function
